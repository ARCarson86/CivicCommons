We’re here to give you a firsthand look. Using a budget calculator idea we borrowed from an interactive <i>New York Times</i> feature last November on the federal budget, you can elevate your knowledge - and have a little fun playing with the state budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With help from our partners at the nonprofit Center for Community Solutions, we have come up with 41 choices to save or bring in money to close the budget gap. The choices are listed in an interactive budget widget on Cleveland.com, so you can build your own version of the state budget and see how much progress you make in balancing it. The goal: turn the red dots to black.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"float:right;width: 130px;margin:20px 0 20px 20px;\"><a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/03/the_budget_widget_try_your_han.html\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/com.theciviccommons.production/images/state-budget/budget-calc.png\" alt=\"Budget Calculator\" title=\"Budget Calculator\" height=\"389\" width=\"130\" style=\"display:block;\" /><p style=\"font-style:italic;font-size:80%;\">Can <b>you</b> balance the state budget?

Here at the Civic Commons, you have the opportunity to engage in a different kind of online conversation about all of these options, even the ones that aren’t in the budget widget. So join the conversation, tell your friends and neighbors where you think the Governor and the General Assembly ought to cut, and where they ought to find more money, and what, if anything, ought to be privatized. And listen, too, to the ideas your friends and neighbors have. Maybe, if we’re lucky, we’ll convince a lawmaker or two to listen in, as well, and take your ideas back to Columbus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><i>(excerpted from The Plain Dealer, by Aaron Marshall)</i></p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.plaindealer.com\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/com.theciviccommons.production/images/state-budget/logo-pd.png\" alt=\"The Plain Dealer\" title=\"The Plain Dealer\" height=\"50\" width=\"600\" style=\"display: block; margin: 20px 0;\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.cleveland.com\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/com.theciviccommons.production/images/state-budget/logo-clevcom.png\" alt=\"Cleveland.com\" title=\"Cleveland.com\" height=\"100\" width=\"200\" style=\"margin:0;\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.communitysolutions.com\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/com.theciviccommons.production/images/state-budget/logo-ccs.png\" alt=\"The Center for Community Solutions\" title=\"The Center for Community Solutions\" height=\"100\" width=\"200\" style=\"margin:0;\" /></a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ideastream.org\"><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/com.theciviccommons.production/images/state-budget/logo-ideastream.png\" alt=\"ideastream\" title=\"ideastream\" height=\"100\" width=\"200\" style=\"margin:0;\" /></a>",
