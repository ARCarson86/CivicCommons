    <title>The Civic Commons: Common Blog</title>
    <description>The Civic Commons is a new way to bring communities together with conversation and emerging technology. We&#8217;re focused on building conversations and connections that have the power to become informed, productive collective civic action.</description>

      <title>Feedback Loop</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had coffee this morning with a boomeranging Clevelander. Carli grew up in Independence, has been working in DC since 2009 (got bit by politics volunteering on the Obama campaign) and is following her heart back to Cleveland. It's her love for the city that's drawing her, not a paramour.&amp;nbsp;She's easily one of the most optimistic people I've spoken to in awhile.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;New people are joining the Civic Commons every day, and, if you're among those new sign ups, we're very excited to welcome you here. If you've never seen them, you might be interested in these short videos we put together to explain a little about what we do and how we do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Prepping for the fifth Civic Commons radio show </title>
      <link>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/prepping-for-the-fifth-civic-commons-radio-show</link>
      <guid>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/prepping-for-the-fifth-civic-commons-radio-show</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We're heading towards our fifth show with Civic Commons radio program. If you haven't heard it yet, the latest can be heard here: &lt;a href="http://goo.gl/nc2Bg" target="_blank"&gt;http://goo.gl/nc2Bg&lt;/a&gt;. One of the challenges we came across on our last show was the fact that everyone on our citizens' roundtable agreed, despite the fact they came from very different backgrounds (academic, entrepreneur, economic development). So, we feel we fell a little short on our commitment to diversity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love radio. There's nothing quite like the intimacy it allows. When it's done well, it feels like a conversation recent transition to a new form government in Cuyahoga County and some of the stumbles along the way. (If you want a preview, you can hear the &lt;a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/com.theciviccommons.production/attachments/3389/original/rogers-greenspan%20intv.mp3?1295262987"&gt;entire, unedited interview&lt;/a&gt; I did with newly installed council members Julian Rogers and Dave Greenspan.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you'll tune in! And if you can't, check back here for the podcast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lessons from the Mobile Town Hall </title>
      <link>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/lessons-from-the-mobile-town-hall</link>
      <guid>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/lessons-from-the-mobile-town-hall</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Wednesday, we spent the lunch hour with about 20 or 30 citizens and Akron Deputy Mayor Dave Lieberth at the public library and the municipal building. &lt;a href="../../conversations/82"&gt;The conversation&lt;/a&gt; was fantastic, and people weren't even in the same room. What we're finding is that technology can actually bring people closer to the officials who work for them. We connected the dep mayor to his constituents via Skype, and that prompted a really interesting question. The mayor's office is only a few blocks away, so why bother with the technology? My colleague Noelle Celeste supplied the perfect response: Would you walk those few blocks to ask that question? The answer to that is usually 'No.'&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Jumo launched its &lt;a href="http://www.jumo.com/"&gt;beta site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A project sprearheaded by Chris Hughes, co-founder of Facebook and chief digital organizer for Barack Obama, Jumo is designed to see if social media can be used to drive volunteerism and donations to causes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What exactly are we doing here? </title>

      <guid>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/what-exactly-are-we-doing-here</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Civic Commons is a grand experiment. We opened the doors last week to a group of you&amp;mdash;close to 200 so far&amp;mdash;to help us test this web environment. And we realize it's maybe not entirely clear what you can do here and why you would want to do it. One of the most common bits of feedback we received last week goes something like this: &amp;ldquo;It feels like the conversation has already happened,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I feel like I'd be interrupting if I jump in.&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;This system is baffling. I keep getting entirely different windows to respond and they're all quirky.&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;This kind of feedback is great. It tells us that what we think we've created isn't working right yet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>National Day of Conversation </title>
      <link>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/national-day-of-conversation</link>
      <guid>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/national-day-of-conversation</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Civic Commons team recently sat down for lunch with citizens in Akron and Cleveland while a couple of other groups gathered independently, all to participate in the National Day of Conversation. Our topic: What's the most important work newly elected officials can address in your community?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Can you volunteer at the Civic Commons? </title>
      <link>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/can-you-volunteer-at-the-civic-commons</link>
      <guid>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/can-you-volunteer-at-the-civic-commons</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We get this question a fair bit, and the answer, of course, is yes. There's lots of ways you can volunteer at the Commons. Volunteering is one of those things that simply makes life better. We help someone else or some organization, and in return, we get a warm fuzzy feeling and the sense that we're more of the person we want to be and less of the person who guiltily eats chocolate chips out of the peanut butter jar with a spoon while watching &amp;ldquo;Glee.&amp;rdquo; And what's great about volunteering at the Commons is that it's not quite like a lot of other volunteer gigs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Great Experiment </title>
      <link>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/a-great-experiment</link>
      <guid>http://www.theciviccommons.com/blog/a-great-experiment</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The CC team spent a beautiful Saturday afternoon recently at Cleveland State's student center, participating in Spotlight Cleveland, an event organized by Senator Sherrod Brown's office to bring together local organizations who have volunteer and networking opportunities for young professionals. We participated for all the reasons you'd expect us to participate&amp;mdash;to connect with other organizations and interested citizens. But what really piqued our interest was the chance to see if we could use an unconventional setting&amp;mdash;the ballroom expo&amp;mdash;for unconventional civic engagement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
