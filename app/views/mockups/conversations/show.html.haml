          Chris reports bad news on the job front. The partisans of misery, also known as the Republican Party, attempting to push the nation back over the economic brink.  After several weeks in which new jobless claims stayed steady at 460,000, today the Labor Department announced new claims had jumped up to 472,000.  Economists are now bracing for a bad monthly jobs report tomorrow.

          Senate Republicans and Nebraska Democrat Ben Nelson teamed up last night to filibuster an extension of unemployment insurance.  It‘s roughly akin to voting against funding for sandbags in the midst of the worst flood in 30 years.

          Chris believes this is compassionless and idiotic, but it is also terrible macro economic policy.  As the Recovery Act spending tapers off and job growth begins to flat line, we now face the very real and very terrifying possibility of a double dip recession.

          So far, the history of the economic crisis has gone like this.  First, there was a financial crisis.  Then, things started to go very badly very, very quickly.  We were losing 800,000 jobs a month.  Then, thanks in large part to the Recovery Act, things started to go less badly, less quickly.  We started losing less and less jobs.

          Things actually started getting better.  We started adding jobs and GDP began to grow again.  But that last bit of momentum has stalled and in the absence of further aggressive government action, we will very likely start to tumble back into the same vicious cycle we saw in late 2008.

          They spiked when the crisis began and started declining and now, the last few weeks, they‘re inching upward again.  We were on the cliff.  We edged away.  Now we‘re sliding back towards the precipice.  And what is the reaction of the Grand Obstructionist Party?  They seem to want to deliver the final shove.

                Well, we hoped that we could get one more vote.  I knew going in that we had our two colleagues from Maine - and I want to thank them for their support - but with the passing of Senator Byrd, we knew we had to have one more Republican and we knew it was going to be tough.  But, as you said in your opening, and I want to thank you for that because I couldn‘t agree with you more, I mean, we‘ve spent nine weeks - nine weeks, trying to overcome a filibuster by Republicans on a jobs bill that would focus on investments and innovation, help for manufacturers, help for small businesses and helping people out of work.  Nine weeks, and we‘ve not been able to overcome this filibuster yet.

                Senator Stabenow, I have to ask you this because it‘s true, obviously, the Republicans are driving this filibuster.  But you do have a Democratic colleague, Senator Ben Nelson, who voted against the bill.  Had he voted for it, it would have passed.  He is the - this - we had 59 votes.  He would have been the 60.

                Well, you know, I‘ve given him my best case.  I mean, I‘ve said, you know, we‘re never going to get out of deficits unless we have 15 million people working.

                And so, for folks concerned about deficits, they should start with focusing on jobs and the jobs crisis and then we will begin to get ourselves out of this deficit hole.

                So my understanding of the plan going forward, and I want you to kind of guide us through here, the Senate‘s in recess, is it going to be the case that the - the late Senator Byrd will be replaced by a Democratic senator in time when you to - to vote on this package when you come back and provide the 60th vote?  Is that how things are looking now?  STABENOW:  Yes.  We expect that the Monday after next that we will have a replacement for Senator Byrd, and once that individual is put into place and sworn in, then Senator Reid intends to take this bill up right away.  He is very committed, as am I, and all of the rest of our caucus to get this done.  
              %p.content
                It‘s really shameful.  I mean, I think about tens of thousands of people in my state that are going to lose help next week, and these are people - most of whom have never lost a job in their life.  They worked hard all their life, and they‘re just trying to hold it together until they can get that next job.

            Do you think there is - have you noticed a correlation between the job situation in the home state of some of your colleagues and the urgency with which they‘re dealing?  Obviously you and Senator Reid are representing two states that have been the hardest hit by this.
