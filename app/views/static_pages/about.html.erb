        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
          The Civic Commons is a new way to bring communities together with conversation and emerging technology. We’re focused on building <strong>conversations and connections that have the power to become informed, productive collective civic action.</strong> 
        </p>
        <p>
          A commons is a shared public space devoted to the public good. And that’s what Civic Commons is—a space we come to so we can learn more about our shared interest and then act on it together. We’ll build it with our contributions, conversations and actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even while this is important, heady stuff, we want to make your civic involvement easy and fun, something you can do after you put the kids to bed, something you might actually want to do, as much as, say, you want to fire up the DVR or head over to Facebook. Think of Civic Commons as <strong>social media for civic good</strong>.
