        <h1>Start a Conversation</h1>
        <p>
        We’re glad you want to start a conversation! Remember, you’re in charge and conversations at the Civic Commons are a little different than elswehere because we keep our principles in mind (We strive to be diverse, credible, transparent, civil, entrepreneurial, participatory and optimistic). That’s not a huge deal, but it comes with a few responsibilities.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Invite people to participate.</li>
          <li>Check in regularly, and stay engaged with people who are participating.</li>
          <li>If there are any problems, let us know. You can always reach us through Help Build the Commons, just under your name in the top right of the screen.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <%= link_to "I agree, continue", new_conversation_path(:accept => true), :class => 'button' %>
          or
          <%= link_to "Cancel", root_url %>
